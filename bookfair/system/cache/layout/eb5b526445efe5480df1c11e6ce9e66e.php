			&quot; I was working with many shopping carts, free and hosted for my clients. There is always something missing. In abantecart I find this gap to be much less. Interface is very easy to use and support is very responsive. This is considering its is free. Go abantecart go!&quot;&lt;br /&gt;

			&quot; Without a doubt the best cart I have used. The title says it all - abantecart is undoubtedly the best I have used. I'm not an expert in site setup, so something this great looking and easy to use is absolutely perfect ... &quot;&lt;br /&gt;

			&quot; Will not regret using this cart. All good is already mentioned, I want to add my experience with support. My problems with some configuration were resolved quick. Faster than paid shopping cart we had before.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;

			&quot; Wow! Abante Cart is really a catch! What a nice experience it was for me. I mean, to have all these features so direct, so quick and easy was really essential for my website. I was able to add some features and a cart to my website in no time ...&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
